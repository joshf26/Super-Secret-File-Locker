# Super Secret File Locker

The ~~most secure~~ worst way to protect your files.

![Demo](demo.gif)

### Usage
Run the following command to lock a file `./supersecretfilelocker.py <file path> <pin>`.

The pin must be numerical. To use a pin longer than 4 digits, you must specify `-l` or `--long`.

Now, your file is locked behind a large number of directories each with a number between 0 and 9.
You must enter the directories in the order of your specified pin to retrieve your file.

Directories are also supported!
